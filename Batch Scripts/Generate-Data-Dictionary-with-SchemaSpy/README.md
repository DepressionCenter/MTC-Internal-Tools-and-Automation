# Export-MCommunity-Groups.bat

## Description
Batch scripts to generate data dictionaries for databases, R datasets, and Pandas dataframes. This is the companion code to [How to use SchemaSpy to document research datasets](https://teamdynamix.umich.edu/TDClient/210/DepressionCenter/KB/ArticleDet?ID=11889).


## Quick Start Guide
+ Download the script for your database type and edit all the variables inside <>.
+ For MS SQL Server, you also need the properties file. Do not edit the contents.
+ Run the script. It will generate one static HTML website for each schema (see [example](https://efdc-automation.web.itd.umich.edu/datadict/)).


## Documentation
+ See the [KB article](https://teamdynamix.umich.edu/TDClient/210/DepressionCenter/KB/ArticleDet?ID=11889) for pre-requisite software and further information.
